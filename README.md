## Installation
My dotfiles are managed with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), a symlink farm manager. To set up the configurations, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/moukle/dotfiles.git
2. Change into the dotfiles directory:
    ```shell
    cd dotfiles
    ```
3. Symlink the desired configuration using Stow. For example, to symlink the hyprland config:
    ```shell
    stow hyprland
    ```
4. Repeat the above step for each configuration you want to set up.

## PyWal
I use wal to generate and change color-schemes on the fly.
In the `wal/.config/wal/templates` folder you find configs for:
- dunst
- tofi
- zathura
- qutebrowser
- ...

Simply change whole setup colors by
```sh
walr.sh <theme> <light>

# example
walr.sh ayu -l
```
